\begin_layout Paragraph
From wikipedia 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conside a cube of side 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 with conducting walls filled with electromagnetic radiation.
 If there is a small hole in one of the walls, the radiation emitted from
 the hole will be characteristic of a perfect black body.
 We will first calculate the spectral energy density wihting the cavity
 and then determine spectral radiance of the emitted radiation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the walls of the cube, the parallel component of the electric field and
 the orthogonal component of the magnetic field must vanish.
 Analogous to the wave function of a particle in a box, one finds that the
 fields are superpositions of periodic functions.
 The three wavelengths 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{3}$
\end_inset

, in the three directions orthogonal to the walls can be:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\lambda_{i}=\frac{2L}{n_{i}},\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 are integers.
 For each set of integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

there are two linear independent solutions (modes).
 According to quantum theory, the energy levels of a mode are given by:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
E_{n_{1,},n_{2},n_{3}}(r)=(r+\frac{1}{2})\frac{hc}{2L}\sqrt{n_{1}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}+n_{3}^{2}}.\label{eq:quant_energy_levels}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The quantum number 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as the number of photons in the mode.
 The two modes for each set of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 correspond to the two polarisation states of the photon which has a spin
 of 1.
 Note that for 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

 the energy of the mode is not zero.
 This vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field is responsible for the
 Casimir effect (non-zero force between two close parallel plates).
 In the following we will calculate the internal energy of the box at temperatur
e 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 relative to the vacuum energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to statistical mechanics, the probability distribution over the
 energy levels of a particular mode is given by:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P_{r}=\frac{exp(-\beta E(r))}{Z(\beta)}.\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here, we have defined 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\beta\triangleq\frac{1}{kT}.\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The denominator 
\family roman

\begin_inset Formula $Z(\beta)$
\end_inset

, is the partition function of a single mode and makes 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{r}$
\end_inset

 properly normalised:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
Z(\beta) & = & \sum_{r=0}^{\infty}exp[-\beta E(r)]\\
 & = & \frac{1}{1-exp[-\beta\varepsilon]}.\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Here we have implicitly defined 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\varepsilon\triangleq\frac{hc}{2L}\sqrt{n_{1}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}+n_{3}^{2}},\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is the energy of a single photon.
 The thermodynamic value of the total energy is the ensemble average for
 the energy, which is the sum of the microstate energies weighted by their
 probabilities.
 This can be expressed in terms of the partition function;
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle E\right\rangle  & = & -\frac{d\, log(Z)}{d\beta}\\
 & = & \frac{\varepsilon}{exp(\beta\varepsilon)-1}.\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

This formula is a special case of the general formula for particles obeying
 Bose-Einstein statistics, such as photons (which are bosons).

The total energy in the box now follows by summing 
\begin_inset Formula $ $
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle E\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 over all allowed single photon states.
 This can be done exactly in the termodynamic limit as 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

.
 In this limit, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 becomes continuous and we can then integrate 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle E\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 over this parameter.
 To calculate the energy in the box this way, we need to evaluate how many
 photon states there are in a given energy range.
 If we write the total number of single photon states with energies between
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon+d\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\varepsilon)d\varepsilon,$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\varepsilon)$
\end_inset

 is the density of states which we'll evaluate in a moment, then we can
 write:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\varepsilon}{exp(\beta\varepsilon)-1}g(\varepsilon)d\varepsilon.\label{eq:quant_total_energy}\end{equation}

\end_inset

To calculate the density of states we rewrite equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:quant_energy_levels"

\end_inset

 as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\varepsilon\triangleq\frac{hc}{2L}n,\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the norm of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{n}=(n_{1},n_{2},n_{3})$
\end_inset

, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\sqrt{n_{1}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}+n_{3}^{2}}.$
\end_inset

For every vector 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 with integer components larger than or equal to zero there are two photon
 states.
 This means that the number of photon states in a certain region of n-space
 is twice the volume of that region.
 An energy range of 
\begin_inset Formula $d\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a shell of thickness 
\begin_inset Formula $dn=(2L/hc)d\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 in n-space.
 Because the components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{n}$
\end_inset

 have to be positive, this shell spans an octant of a sphere.
 The number of photon states 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\varepsilon)d\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 in an energy range 
\begin_inset Formula $d\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is thus given by:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
g(\varepsilon)d\varepsilon & = & 2\frac{1}{8}4\pi n^{2}dn\\
 & = & \frac{8\pi L^{3}}{h^{3}c^{3}}\varepsilon^{2}d\varepsilon.\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Inserting this into equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:quant_total_energy"

\end_inset

 gives:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U=L^{3}\frac{8\pi}{h^{3}c^{3}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\varepsilon^{3}}{exp(\beta\varepsilon)-1}d\varepsilon.\end{equation}

\end_inset

From this equation one easily derives the spectral energy density as a function
 of wavelength 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\nu,T)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{U}{L^{3}}=\int_{0}^{\infty}u(\nu,T)d\nu,\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
u(\nu,T)=\frac{8\pi h\nu^{3}}{c^{3}}\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1}.\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $u(\nu,T)$
\end_inset

 is known as the black body spectrum.
 It is a spectral energy density function with units of energy per unit
 wavelength per unit volume.

Since the radiation is the same in all directions, and propagates at the
 speed of light, the spectral radiance exiting the small hole is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
I(\nu,T) & = & \frac{u(\nu,T)c}{4\pi}\\
 & = & \frac{2h\nu^{3}}{c^{2}}\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1}.\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Note that dimensional analysis shows that the unit of steradians, shown
 in the denominator of the left hand side of the above equation, is generated
 in and carried through the derivation but does not appear in any of the
 dimensions for any element of the left side of the equation.
