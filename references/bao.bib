title = {Motivation, key science projects, standards and assumptions},
abstract = {The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) represents the next major, and natural, step in radio astronomical facilities, providing two orders of magnitude increase in collecting area over existing telescopes. In a series of meetings, starting in Groningen, the Netherlands (August 2002) and culminating in a `science retreat' in Leiden (November 2003), the SKA International Science Advisory Committee (ISAC), conceived of, and carried-out, a complete revision of the SKA science case (to appear in New Astronomy Reviews). This preface includes: (i) general introductory material, (ii) summaries of the key science programs, and (iii) a detailed listing of standards and assumptions used in the revised science case.},

title = {The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey: survey design and first data release},
abstract = {The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey is a survey of 240000 emission-line galaxies in the distant Universe, measured with the AAOmega spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). The primary aim of the survey is to precisely measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) imprinted on the spatial distribution of these galaxies at look-back times of 4-8Gyr. The target galaxies are selected using ultraviolet (UV) photometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer satellite, with a flux limit of NUV < 22.8mag. We also require that the targets are detected at optical wavelengths, specifically in the range 20.0 < r < 22.5mag. We use the Lyman break method applied to the UV colours, with additional optical colour limits, to select high-redshift galaxies. The galaxies generally have strong emission lines, permitting reliable redshift measurements in relatively short exposure times on the AAT. The median redshift of the galaxies is zmed = 0.6. The redshift range containing 90 per cent of the galaxies is 0.2 < z < 1.0. The survey will sample a volume of ~1Gpc3 over a projected area on the sky of 1000 deg2, with an average target density of 350deg-2. Detailed forecasts indicate that the survey will measure the BAO scale to better than 2 per cent and the tangential and radial acoustic wave scales to approximately 3 and 5 per cent, respectively. Combining the WiggleZ constraints with existing cosmic microwave background measurements and the latest supernova data, the marginalized uncertainties in the cosmological model are expected to be σ(Ωm) = 0.02 and σ(w) = 0.07 (for a constant w model). The WiggleZ measurement of w will constitute a robust, precise and independent test of dark energy models. This paper provides a detailed description of the survey and its design, as well as the spectroscopic observations, data reduction and redshift measurement techniques employed. It also presents an analysis of the properties of the target galaxies, including emission-line diagnostics which show that they are mostly extreme starburst galaxies, and Hubble Space Telescope images, which show that they contain a high fraction of interacting or distorted systems. In conjunction with this paper, we make a public data release of data for the first 100000 galaxies measured for the project.},

title = {Detecting the Baryons in Matter Power Spectra},
abstract = {We examine power spectra from the Abell/ACO rich cluster survey and the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) for observational evidence of features produced by the baryons. A nonnegligible baryon fraction produces relatively sharp oscillatory features at specific wavenumbers in the matter power spectrum. However, the mere existence of baryons will also produce a global suppression of the power spectrum. We look for both of these features using the false discovery rate statistic. We show that the window effects on the Abell/ACO power spectrum are minimal, which has allowed for the discovery of discrete oscillatory features in the power spectrum. On the other hand, there are no statistically significant oscillatory features in the 2dFGRS power spectrum, which is expected from the survey's broad window function. After accounting for window effects we apply a scale-independent bias to the 2dFGRS power spectrum, PAbell(k)=b2P2dF(k) and b=3.2. We find that the overall shapes of the Abell/ACO and the biased 2dFGRS power spectra are entirely consistent over the range 0.02<=k<=0.15h Mpc-1. We examine the range of Ωmatter and baryon fraction, for which these surveys could detect significant suppression in power. The reported baryon fractions for both the Abell/ACO and 2dFGRS surveys are high enough to cause a detectable suppression in power (after accounting for errors, windows, and k-space sampling). Using the same technique, we also examine, given the best-fit baryon density obtained from big bang nucleosynthesis, whether it is possible to detect additional suppression due to dark matter-baryon interaction. We find that the limit on dark matter cross section/mass derived from these surveys is the same as those ruled out in a recent study by Chen, Hannestad, {\&} Scherrer.},

title = {Constraints on Fundamental Cosmological Parameters with Upcoming Redshifted 21 cm Observations},
abstract = {Constraints on cosmological parameters from upcoming measurements with the Mileura Wide-field Array Low Frequency Demonstrator (MWA LFD) of the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum are forecasted assuming a flat ΛCDM cosmology and assuming that the reionization of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium occurs below a redshift of z=8. We find that observations with the MWA LFD cannot constrain the underlying cosmology in this scenario. In principle, a similar experiment with a 10-fold increase in collecting area could provide useful constraints on the slope of the inflationary power spectrum, ns, and the running of the spectral index, αs, but these constraints are subject to the caveat that even a small reionization contribution could be confused with the cosmological signal. In addition to the redshifted 21 cm signal, we include two nuisance components in our analysis related to the systematics and astrophysical foregrounds present in low-frequency radio observations. These components are found to be well separated from the signal and contribute little uncertainty (<30%) to the measured values of the cosmological model parameters.},

title = {Determining neutrino properties using future galaxy redshift surveys},
abstract = {Current measurements of the large-scale structure (LSS) of galaxies are able to place an ~0.5eV upper limit on the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. An order-of-magnitude improvement in raw sensitivity, together with an insensitivity to systematic effects, is needed to reach the lowest value allowed by particle physics experiments. We consider the prospects of determining both the neutrino mass scale and the number of massive neutrinos using future redshift surveys, specifically those undertaken with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), with and without additional constraints from the upcoming Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment. If the sum of the neutrino masses then the imprint of neutrinos on LSS should be enough, on its own, to establish the neutrino mass scale and, considered alongside CMB constraints, it will also determine the number of massive neutrinos Nν, and hence the mass hierarchy. If {\Sigma} mi ~ 0.05 eV, at the bottom end of the allowed range, then a combination of LSS, CMB and particle physics constraints should be able to determine and the hierarchy. If is in the specific range 0.1- 0.25 eV, then a combination of LSS, CMB and particle physics experiments should determine , but not Nν or the hierarchy. Once an SKA-like LSS survey is available there are good prospects of obtaining a full understanding of the conventional neutrino sector, and a chance of finding evidence for sterile neutrinos.},

title = {The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey: galaxy clustering per spectral type},
abstract = {We have calculated the two-point correlation functions in redshift space, ξ(σ, π), for galaxies of different spectral types in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. Using these correlation functions, we are able to estimate values of the linear redshift-space distortion parameter, β≡Ω0.6m/b, the pairwise velocity dispersion, a, and the real-space correlation function, ξ(r), for galaxies with both relatively low star formation rates (for which the present rate of star formation is less than 10 per cent of its past averaged value) and galaxies with higher current star formation activity. At small separations, the real-space clustering of passive galaxies is very much stronger than that of the more actively star-forming galaxies; the correlation-function slopes are, respectively, 1.93 and 1.50, and the relative bias between the two classes is a declining function of scale. On scales larger than 10 h-1 Mpc, there is evidence that the relative bias tends to a constant, bpassive/bactive~= 1. This result is consistent with the similar degrees of redshift-space distortions seen in the correlation functions of the two classes - the contours of ξ(σ, π) require βactive= 0.49 +/- 0.13 and βpassive= 0.48 +/- 0.14. The pairwise velocity dispersion is highly correlated with β. Despite this, a significant difference is seen between the two classes. Over the range 8-20 h-1 Mpc, the pairwise velocity dispersion has mean values of 416 +/- 76 and 612 +/- 92 km s-1 for the active and passive galaxy samples, respectively. This is consistent with the expectation from morphological segregation, in which passively evolving galaxies preferentially inhabit the cores of high-mass virialized regions.},

title = {Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant},
abstract = {We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 <= z <= 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10%-15% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M >= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q_0 < 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda > 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda > 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda > 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega_Lambda = 0 and q_0 >= 0.},

abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) will map out the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature with unprecedented accuracy and greatly improve the constraints on the acceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe. BOSS will upgrade the SDSS fiber-fed spectrographs to 1000 fibers, and improve the throughput from 3600 - 10,050 Angstroms. For the five years from 2009-2014, we will map 1.5 million luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at z<0.7 over a footprint of 10,000 square degrees. A simultaneous survey of 160,000 QSOs will map the hydrogen gas in absorption at redshifts 2.3 < z < 3. BOSS will provide the definitive measurement of the low redshift (z<0.7) BAO scale, and it will pioneer a powerful new method of measuring BAO at high redshift with QSOs. This will achieve precise stand-alone constraints on the properties of dark energy, the curvature of space, and the Hubble constant. The absolute distance measurements will reach a precision of 1% at z=0.35, 1% at z=0.6, and 1.5% at z=2.5. As part of the SDSS-III project, BOSS will produce a large, well-calibrated public database to support a broad range of astronomical research.},

title = {Understanding the H2/HI ratio in galaxies},
abstract = {We revisit the mass ratio ηgalaxy between molecular hydrogen (H2) and atomic hydrogen (HI) in different galaxies from a phenomenological and theoretical viewpoint. First, the local H2 mass function (MF) is estimated from the local CO luminosity function (LF) of the FCRAO Extragalactic CO Survey, adopting a variable CO-to-H2 conversion fitted to nearby observations. This implies an average H2 density and in the local Universe. Secondly, we investigate the correlations between ηgalaxy and global galaxy properties in a sample of 245 local galaxies. Based on these correlations we introduce four phenomenological models for ηgalaxy, which we apply to estimate H2 masses for each HI galaxy in the HIPASS catalogue. The resulting H2 MFs (one for each model for ηgalaxy) are compared to the reference H2 MF derived from the CO LF, thus allowing us to determine the Bayesian evidence of each model and to identify a clear best model, in which, for spiral galaxies, ηgalaxy negatively correlates with both galaxy Hubble type and total gas mass. Thirdly, we derive a theoretical model for ηgalaxy for regular galaxies based on an expression for their axially symmetric pressure profile dictating the degree of molecularization. This model is quantitatively similar to the best phenomenological one at redshift z = 0, and hence represents a consistent generalization while providing a physical explanation for the dependence of ηgalaxy on global galaxy properties. Applying the best phenomenological model for ηgalaxy to the HIPASS sample, we derive the first integral cold gas MF (HI + H2 + helium) of the local universe.},

The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will provide the only means of studying the cosmic evolution of neutral hydrogen (HI) which, alongside information on star formation from the radio continuum, is needed to understand how stars formed from gas within dark-matter over-densities and the r{\^o}les of gas accretion and galaxy merging. `All hemisphere' HI redshift surveys to z ˜ 1.5 are feasible with wide-field-of-view realizations of the SKA and, by measuring the galaxy power spectrum in exquisite detail, will allow the first precise studies of the equation-of-state of dark energy. The SKA will be capable of other uniquely powerful cosmological studies including the measurement of the dark-matter power spectrum using weak gravitational lensing, and the precise measurement of H0 using extragalactic water masers. The SKA is likely to become the premier dark-energy-measuring machine, bringing breakthroughs in cosmology beyond those likely to be made possible by combining CMB (e.g. Planck), optical (e.g. LSST, SNAP) and other early-21st-century datasets.},

title = {ALFALFA: a Legacy Extragalactic HI Survey},
abstract = {The Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey aims to map 7000 square degreees of the high galactic latitude sky visible from Arecibo, providing an HI line spectral database covering the redshift range between -1600 km/s and 18,000 km/s with 5 km/s resolution. Exploiting the Arecibo telescope's large collecting area and small beam size, ALFALFA is specifically designed to probe the faint end of the HI mass function in the local universe and will provide a census of HI in the surveyed sky area to faint flux limits, making it especially useful in synergy with wide area surveys conducted at other wavelengths. ALFALFA will also provide the basis for studies of the dynamics of galaxies within the Local and nearby superclusters, will allow measurement of the HI diameter function, and enable a first wide-area blind search for local HI tidal features, HI absorbers at z<0.06 and OH megamasers in the redshift range 0.16<z<0.25. Although completion of the survey will require some five years, public access to the ALFALFA data and data products will be provided in a timely manner, through data releases at several levels of complexity, thus allowing its application for studies beyond those targeted by the ALFALFA collaboration. Results of survey precursor observations are described in astro-ph/0508301 and publicly acccessible through robust web tools. Survey observations started in February 2005. The first release of survey data is scheduled for the first half of 2006, compatibly with current expectations of telescope time allocations. ALFALFA is an open collaboration and welcomes new interested participants. For details, see http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/alfalfa/joining.php and astro-ph/0508300.

title = {On the Robustness of the Acoustic Scale in the Low-Redshift Clustering of Matter},
abstract = {We discuss the effects of nonlinear structure formation on the signature of acoustic oscillations in the late-time galaxy distribution. We argue that the dominant nonlinear effect is the differential motion of pairs of tracers separated by 150 Mpc. These motions are driven by bulk flows and cluster formation and are much smaller than the acoustic scale itself. We present a model for the nonlinear evolution based on the distribution of pairwise Lagrangian displacements that provides a quantitative model for the degradation of the acoustic signature, even for biased tracers in redshift space. The Lagrangian displacement distribution can be calibrated with a significantly smaller set of simulations than would be needed to construct a precise power spectrum. By connecting the acoustic signature in the Fourier basis with that in the configuration basis, we show that the acoustic signature is more robust than the usual Fourier-space intuition would suggest, because the beat frequency between the peaks and troughs of the acoustic oscillations is a very small wavenumber that is well inside the linear regime. We argue that any possible shift of the acoustic scale is related to infall on a scale of 150 Mpc, which is O(0.5%) fractionally at first order, even at z=0. For the matter, there is a first-order cancellation such that the mean shift is O(10-4). However, galaxy bias can circumvent this cancellation and produce a subpercent systematic bias.},

title = {Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Temperature Analysis},
abstract = {We present new full-sky temperature maps in five frequency bands from 23 to 94 GHz, based on data from the first 3 years of the WMAP sky survey. The new maps are consistent with the first-year maps and are more sensitive. The 3 year maps incorporate several improvements in data processing made possible by the additional years of data and by a more complete analysis of the polarization signal. These include several new consistency tests as well as refinements in the gain calibration and beam response models. We employ two forms of multifrequency analysis to separate astrophysical foreground signals from the CMB, each of which improves on our first-year analyses. First, we form an improved ``Internal Linear Combination'' (ILC) map, based solely on WMAP data, by adding a bias-correction step and by quantifying residual uncertainties in the resulting map. Second, we fit and subtract new spatial templates that trace Galactic emission; in particular, we now use low-frequency WMAP data to trace synchrotron emission instead of the 408 MHz sky survey. The WMAP point source catalog is updated to include 115 new sources whose detection is made possible by the improved sky map sensitivity. We derive the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy using a hybrid approach that combines a maximum likelihood estimate at low l (large angular scales) with a quadratic cross-power estimate for l>30. The resulting multifrequency spectra are analyzed for residual point source contamination. At 94 GHz the unmasked sources contribute 128+/-27 μK2 to l(l+1)Cl/2π at l=1000. After subtracting this contribution, our best estimate of the CMB power spectrum is derived by averaging cross-power spectra from 153 statistically independent channel pairs. The combined spectrum is cosmic variance limited to l=400, and the signal-to-noise ratio per l-mode exceeds unity up to l=850. For bins of width Δl/l=3%, the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds unity up to l=1000. The first two acoustic peaks are seen at l=220.8+/-0.7 and l=530.9+/-3.8, respectively, while the first two troughs are seen at l=412.4+/-1.9 and l=675.2+/-11.1. The rise to the third peak is unambiguous; when the WMAP data are combined with higher resolution CMB measurements, the existence of a third acoustic peak is well established. Spergel et al. use the 3 year temperature and polarization data to constrain cosmological model parameters. A simple six-parameter ΛCDM model continues to fit CMB data and other measures of large-scale structure remarkably well. The new polarization data produce a better measurement of the optical depth to reionization, τ=0.089+/-0.03. This new and tighter constraint on τ helps break a degeneracy with the scalar spectral index, which is now found to be ns=0.960+/-0.016. If additional cosmological data sets are included in the analysis, the spectral index is found to be ns=0.947+/-0.015.

title = {Probing Dark Energy Using Baryonic Oscillations in the Galaxy Power Spectrum as a Cosmological Ruler},
abstract = {We show that the baryonic oscillations expected in the galaxy power spectrum may be used as a ``standard cosmological ruler'' to facilitate accurate measurement of the cosmological equation of state. Our approach involves a straightforward measurement of the oscillation ``wavelength'' in Fourier space, which is fixed by fundamental linear physics in the early universe and hence is highly model-independent. We quantify the ability of future large-scale galaxy redshift surveys with mean redshifts z~1 and ~3 to delineate the baryonic peaks in the power spectrum, and we derive corresponding constraints on the parameter w describing the equation of state of the dark energy. For example, a survey of 4 times the Sloan volume at z~1 can produce a measurement with accuracy Δw~0.1. We suggest that this method of measuring the dark energy powerfully complements other probes, such as Type Ia supernovae, and suffers from a different (and arguably less serious) set of systematic uncertainties.},

title = {Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Peak in the Large-Scale Correlation Function of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies},
abstract = {We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopic sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h-3 Gpc3 over 3816 deg2 and 0.16<z<0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100 h-1 Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z~1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4% fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5% accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Ωmh2 to 8% and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Ωm=0.273+/-0.025+0.123(1+w0)+0.137ΩK. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is ΩK=-0.010+/-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

title = {The cosmological constant and dark energy},
abstract = {Physics welcomes the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein's cosmological constant, Λ; today the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics also suggests that dark energy could be dynamical, allowing for the arguably appealing picture of an evolving dark-energy density approaching its natural value, zero, and small now because the expanding universe is old. This would alleviate the classical problem of the curious energy scale of a millielectron volt associated with a constant Λ. Dark energy may have been detected by recent cosmological tests. These tests make a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lema{\^\i}tre model, in which the gravitational inverse-square law is applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one-quarter of the critical Einstein de Sitter value. The case for detection of dark energy is not yet as convincing but still serious; we await more data, which may be derived from work in progress. Planned observations may detect the evolution of the dark-energy density; a positive result would be a considerable stimulus for attempts at understanding the microphysics of dark energy. This review presents the basic physics and astronomy of the subject, reviews the history of ideas, assesses the state of the observational evidence, and comments on recent developments in the search for a fundamental theory.},

title = {Seeing Dark Energy 10 Years Later},
abstract = {After Hubble's discovery of cosmic expansion, cosmologists expected that the mass and fate of the Universe would be revealed by its deceleration. In the 1990's two teams took up the challenge to measure the cosmic deceleration using yardsticks built from exploding stars called supernovae. I was a member of the High-z Team. In the fall of 1997 I was leading the reduction and analysis of our supernova data. After calibrating the relation between flux and redshift for nearby and distant supernovae, I used our data to calculate the normalized mass of the Universe, Ωm, required to cause the deceleration exhibited by the supernovae. The answer was (significantly) negative! This was my first indication that the expansion is accelerating. I then added Einstein's cosmological constant (a dark energy) to the mix. I found a nonvanishing cosmological constant at the 99.8% confidence level. In February 1998, Alex Filippenko and I presented these findings on behalf of the High-z Team (Alex spoke). We published our conclusions a few months later in Riess et al. 1998. Understanding the nature of the dark energy poses an enormous challenge for physics and astronomy alike.},

title = {Forecasts for dark energy measurements with future HI surveys},
abstract = {We use two independent methods to forecast the dark energy measurements achievable by combining future galaxy redshift surveys based on the radio HI emission line with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Planck satellite. In the first method, we focus on the `standard ruler' provided by the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) length-scale. In the second method, we utilize additional information encoded in the galaxy power spectrum including galaxy bias from velocity-space distortions and the growth of cosmic structure. We find that a radio synthesis array with about 10 per cent of the collecting area of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), equipped with a wide (10-100 deg2) field of view, would have the capacity to perform a 20000 deg2 redshift survey to a maximum redshift zmax ~ 0.8 and thereby produce dark energy measurements that are competitive with surveys likely to be undertaken by optical telescopes around 2015. There would then be powerful arguments for adding collecting area to such a `Phase 1' SKA because of the square-law scaling of survey speed with telescope sensitivity for HI surveys, compared to the linear scaling for optical redshift surveys. The full SKA telescope should, by performing a 20000 deg2 HI redshift survey to zmax ~ 2 around 2020, yield an accurate measurement of cosmological parameters independent of CMB data sets. Combining CMB (Planck) and galaxy power spectrum (SKA) measurements will drive errors in the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w well below the 1 per cent level. The major systematic uncertainty in these forecasts is the lack of direct information about the mass function of high-redshift HI-emitting galaxies. `Stacking experiments' with SKA pathfinders will play an important role in resolving this uncertainty.},

title = {The Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey},
abstract = {This paper describes the Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With this data release, the imaging of the northern Galactic cap is now complete. The survey contains images and parameters of roughly 287 million objects over 9583 deg2, including scans over a large range of Galactic latitudes and longitudes. The survey also includes 1.27 million spectra of stars, galaxies, quasars, and blank sky (for sky subtraction) selected over 7425 deg2 . This release includes much more stellar spectroscopy than was available in previous data releases and also includes detailed estimates of stellar temperatures, gravities, and metallicities. The results of improved photometric calibration are now available, with uncertainties of roughly 1% in g, r, i, and z, and 2% in u, substantially better than the uncertainties in previous data releases. The spectra in this data release have improved wavelength and flux calibration, especially in the extreme blue and extreme red, leading to the qualitatively better determination of stellar types and radial velocities. The spectrophotometric fluxes are now tied to point-spread function magnitudes of stars rather than fiber magnitudes. This gives more robust results in the presence of seeing variations, but also implies a change in the spectrophotometric scale, which is now brighter by roughly 0.35 mag. Systematic errors in the velocity dispersions of galaxies have been fixed, and the results of two independent codes for determining spectral classifications and redshifts are made available. Additional spectral outputs are made available, including calibrated spectra from individual 15 minute exposures and the sky spectrum subtracted from each exposure. We also quantify a recently recognized underestimation of the brightnesses of galaxies of large angular extent due to poor sky subtraction; the bias can exceed 0.2 mag for galaxies brighter than r=14 mag.},

title = {Cosmology at low frequencies: The 21 cm transition and the high-redshift Universe},
abstract = {Observations of the high-redshift Universe with the 21 cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen promise to open an entirely new window onto the early phases of cosmic structure formation. Here we review the physics of the 21 cm transition, focusing on processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe the insights to be gained from such observations. These include measuring the matter power spectrum at z˜50, observing the formation of the cosmic web and the first luminous sources, and mapping the reionization of the intergalactic medium. The epoch of reionization is of particular interest, because large HII regions will seed substantial fluctuations in the 21 cm background. We also discuss the experimental challenges involved in detecting this signal, with an emphasis on the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. These increase rapidly toward low frequencies and are especially severe for the highest redshift applications. Assuming that these difficulties can be overcome, the redshifted 21 cm line will offer unique insight into the high-redshift Universe, complementing other probes but providing the only direct, three-dimensional view of structure formation from z˜200 to 6.},
