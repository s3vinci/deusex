Like all living organisms, the fruit fly uses sensory information to navigate
 its world.
 To a first approximation a fruit fly
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

s behaviour in response to a sensory input can be described as a decision
 making process of approach or retreat.
 One such sense that the fly uses to decide whether to approach or retreat
 is the sense of smell, which is a well-studied function, employed to gather
 information about the environment, find food, mating partners, and detect
 dangerous conditions signaled by harmful odours.
 Flies are attracted and repelled to many odours innately (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Niewalda:2008bm"

\end_inset

), but also show ability to learn new odours (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Waddell:2010iw"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When exposed to most odours, the response behaviour of flies depends on
 experience: if an odour is associated with a sweetened reward (CS+, or
 conditioned stimulus) and another odour offers no reward (CS- or unconditioned
 stimulus) the flies will show a preference for the rewarded odour in a
 binary choice test (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.\,1.1\,A$
\end_inset

 top panel).
 However, if an odour is associated with a punishment (CS+) such as a shock,
 fruit flies can be conditioned aversively to odours (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Perisse:2013fpa"

\end_inset

) and will choose the neutral odour (CS-, 
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.\thinspace1.1\,A$
\end_inset

 bottom panel).
 Understanding how these memories of odours are generated and how they affect
 behaviour is an area of current research.
 Researchers are also beginning to understand how innate and learned olfactory
 behaviours interact with each other.
 However, until now there have been few computational driven approaches
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Luo:2010fb,Wessnitzer:2011dj"

\end_inset

) that have converted word models into mechanistic models that can explain
 mathematically the growing behavioural data, make predictions and testable
 hypotheses.
 We shall discuss these computational methods in Section 1.5.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A) In the learning paradigm the fly is shown a simple odour which is called
 the CS- (conditional stimulus without reinforcement) for 2 minutes in the
 appetitive training protocol.
 Afterwards, a fly is put into an empty chamber for 30 second where only
 air is present.
 Finally, an odour is shown that is paired with a reinforcement (CS+) which
 can be either sugar or shock.
 After that, the fly is tested for odour preference when given a choice
 between the CS+ and CS-.
 Note: In the case of aversive training, the reinforced odour (CS+) is shown
 first.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
B) Normalized calcium imaging response in the 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$

 the calcium response increasing for aversive learning and decreasing after
 appetitive learning (averaged from ten flies).
\end_layout

C) (i) DA neurons representing aversive reinforcement.
 Studies suggest that neurons in PPL1 convey negative reinforcement and
 are strongly activated by shock (

).
 In this illustration a selection of DA neurons innervating MB zones and
 the MB-M3 neurons on the tip of the

D) The valence learning olfactory circuit is made of a group of approximately
 2.000 KCs which are tasked with odour identification.
 There are two groups of dopaminergic neurons that signal either shock or
 sugar and depress connections between KCs and MBONs.
 M4 MBON biases towards retreat behaviour while MVP2 MBONs biases towards
 approach behaviour.
 The MVP2 MBON in this figure is show inhibiting the M4 retreat neuron (David
 Owald - personal correspondence).
 The DPM neuron decreases its activity during hunger and disinhibits KCs
 which are known to innervate the MVP2 Approach neuron.

Odour representation become concentration invariant in the early stages
 of olfactory processes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flies detect odours using approximately 1,200 olfactory receptor neurons
 (ORNs) housed in their antennae.
 The tuning of each ORN is determined by a single odorant receptor gene,
 which controls whether the ORN is broadly or narrowly tuned to odours (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Hallem:2006iu"

\end_inset

).
 Axons from the ORN expressing the same receptor always converge on the
 same glomerulus.
 Their activity is picked up by inhibitory and excitatory projection neurons
 which perform normalization of the odour (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Luo:2010fb"

\end_inset

).
 Excitatory projection neurons deliver information to the calyces in the
 mushroom body while both inhibitory projection neurons and ePNs send informatio
n to the Lateral Horn.
 The Lateral Horn is associated with innate behavioral responses to odors,
 such as sex-specific responses to pheromones during courtship (Datta et
 al 2008), whereas the mushroom body is required for learned responses to
 odors (

\begin_layout Section
The MB is the centre for associative learning in the fruit fly
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mushroom bodies are symmetrical structures with each mushroom body being
 composed of approximately 2,000 Kenyon Cells (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Turner:2008eo"

\end_inset

).
 Lesion experiments and synaptic blocking of mushroom bodies output have
 shown that that the mushroom body plays a critical role in memory formation
 and retrieval (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Heisenberg:2009bu"

\end_inset

).
 While odour coding in the antennae was dense, the MB is believed to maintain
 a sparse and high-dimensional odour representation.
 Experimental studies have shown that the MB maintains a sparse representation
 of odours as each odour activates approximately 10% of KCs (approximately
 150 - 200 neurons , 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Subsection
Similar odours have overlapping representations in the MB
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous experimental studies have shown that odours with similar chemical
 properties have overlapping representations in the MBs (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Campbell:2013fb"

\end_inset

).
 Behavioural experiments have shown flies have the ability to both generalize
 similar odours and separate them depending on the training protocol.
 If we use an odour as a CS+ and train the fly to remember it as predicting
 reward the fly will showcase the same behaviour when exposed to a previously
 unexposed similar odour.
 However if the second odour is shown to the fly during training as the
 neutral odour (CS-), the fly will not show preference to it when compared
 to another neutral odour (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Campbell:2013fb"

).
 The fly appears to be able to be caable to both generalize similar odours
 and distinguish them depending on past experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The MB recurrent activity is critical for stabilizing odour memories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimental studies have shown that olfactory representations in the mushroom
 bodies are modulated by the anterior paired lateral (APL) neuron (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 Each mushroom body is innervated by a single 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

giant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 APL neuron, which transmits inhibition to the mushroom body calyx as well
 as the vertical and medial lobes.
 It also appears that the APL receives input from KCs in the vertical and
 medial lobe and inhibits KCs at their dendritic terminals in the calyx.
 The APL releases GABA at a rate proportional to its level of depolarization
 and appears to play a role normalizing KC responses to odours and maintaining
 sparseness (

MBONs guide approach and retreat behaviours
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Outputs from approximately 2,000 Kenyon cells of the mushroom body converge
 onto a population of 34 mushroom body output neurons (MBONs).
 The MBON dendrites divide the two lobes and the base of the pedunculus
 into a small number nonoverlapping compartments, within which the dendrite
 densely contacts either all KCs or an anatomically distinct subpopulation.
 KC axons in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha'$
\end_inset

 lobes are clustered into anterior, middle, and posterior groups, in the
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $\beta'$
\end_inset

 lobes into posterior, surface, and core groups, and in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 lobe into main and dorsal groups.
 The MBONs innervating each compartment are genetically distinct, and each
 projects characteristically to other regions of the brain.
 MBONs project from the mushroom body to several regions.
 A small number of excitatory neurons innervating the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha'$
\end_inset

 lobes project to lateral horn, a region implicated in control of innate
 odor-related behaviors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every MBON projects to four neuropils just outside the mushroom body: the
 crepine, the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP) the superior intermediate
 protocerebrum and the superior lateral protocerebrum where input from the
 approach and retreat MBONs is believed to be transformed into motor control.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can classify MBONs according to the behaviour they bias towards, as two
 recent studies have shown by silencing and activating each of the 32 MBONs;
 they either promote approach or retreat behaviour (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Aso:2014bh,Owald:2015cn"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, experiments for one retreat promoting MBON (
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta')$
\end_inset

 have shown bi-directional change in firing rate of the neuron controlled
 by the reinforcement used (appetitive or aversive).
 Calcium imaging before and after training have shown the response decreases
 compared to the naive response after appetitive learning and increased
 after aversive learning (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.2B$
\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, optogenetic activation of the 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

 neurons changed a neutral behaviour into avoidance behaviour and blocking
 the neuron converted a naive odour approach into odour retreat in naïve
 flies (flies that had an innate repulsion to the odour without learning,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Owald:2015cn"

\end_inset

).
 Converseley, the MVP2 MBON neuron is known to promote approach behaviour.
 Interestingly, there is evidence that the 
\begin_inset Formula $MVP2$

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approach
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 MBON inhibits the 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

 retreat MBON (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig1.1D$
\end_inset

, David Owald - private correspondence).
 It is not know whether any of the retreat MBONs inhibit approach MBONs.
 All though there are 32 MBONs, for our initial study we shall restrict
 our modelling efforts to only two that have been studied by our experimental
 collaborator: the 
\begin_inset Formula $MVP2$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approach
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 biasing neuron and the 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$

 retreat biasing neuron.
 Modelling these two neurons will allow us to reproduce the valence coding
 space.

\begin_layout Section
DAs convey reward and punishment signals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dopaminergic neurons (DAs) are the most prevalent modulatory neurons that
 innervate the mushroom bodies.
 There are distinct dopaminergic neurons that provide positive and negative
 value signals.
 The two major clusters where most DAs reside are the PPL and the PAM clusters
 (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.1.1C$
\end_inset

).
 Positive reinforcement are provided by subsets of the approximately 100
 DAs in the PAM cluster (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Burke:2012jt"

\end_inset

).
 They predominately innervate nearby zones in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta,\beta',\gamma$
\end_inset

 lobes.
 Negative reinforcement such as from electric shock or bitter substances
 appears to be conveyed by DAs housed in the PPL cluster.
 Each PPL DA that innervates the mushroom bodies projects presynaptic terminals
 on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha’$
\end_inset

 lobe(David Owald & Scott Waddell – in review).
 The dendrites of MBONs is restricted to few DA zones.
 For example for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

retreat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 MBON we previously discussed (
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

 ) experimental data exists to support that the axons from sugar rewarding
 dopaminergic neurons overlap with the dendrites of the MBON (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Owald:2015cn"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DAs convey reward and punishment signals in different areas of the mushroom
 body 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distinct DAs convey the effects of sugar and water reward as opposed to
 the same neurons representing subjective value such as in the case of negative
 reinforcing DAs (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Perisse:2013fp"

\end_inset

).
 The sugar and water responsive DAs project to unique zones on the MB lobes,
 thus suggesting that learning-related plasticity is represented at different
 axon terminals along the lobes of the mushroom body.
 It is believed that since DAs reaches a subset of KCs axons, they modify
 KC output synapses onto MBONs in their respective zone.
 Thus water memories and sugar memories are predicted to have unique KC-MBON
 connections that represent them (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Lin:2014ix"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DA state control
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sugar memory is most robustly expressed in hungry flies and similarly, thirst
 promotes the expression of water memory.
 It appears that to form these memories, different zones of the MB provides
 the anatomical requirements in which state control be implemented.
 Interestingly, a group of DA neurons that provide the inhibitory constraint
 to the expression of sugar memory (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Lin:2014ix"

\end_inset

) occupy the same zones in the MB as the MVP2 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approach
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 neuron, whose activity drives approach behaviour.
 Thus it seems likely that the internal state of hunger skews the balance
 of MBON pathways to favour approach.
 A current study (David Owala - personal correspondence) has shown that
 the MVP2 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approach
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 neuron increases its response to an odour after it has been starved which
 biases the behaviour towards approach (David Owald - personal correspondence,
 
\begin_inset Formula $Fig\,.\,1.3$
\end_inset

).
 This adds another layer of complexity to the valence learning model which
 is state modulation of behaviour.

DA modulated learning changes odour drive to KC-MBON synapses

 proposes that learning modifies subsets of KC-MBON pathways which in naive
 flies are balanced (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Appetitive responding DAs promote odor approach by depressing odor drive

\begin_layout Section
Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) as a candidate for plasticity at
 the KC-MBON synapses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A candidate mechanism for valence learning has been proposed in a recent
 study in the locust, a similar system to Drosophila (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Cassenaer:2012hxba"

\end_inset

).
 They have shown that KC-MBON synapses usually obbey the spike-timing-dependent
 plasticity (STDP) rule.
 STDP can be seen as a spike-based variant of the Hebbian rule where synaptic
 change depends on the relative timing of pre and postsynaptic action potential
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Bi:1998ve"

\end_inset

).
 During STDP, a synapse potentiates when the postsynaptic spike happens
 after the pre-synaptic spike within a time window of the order of tens
 of milliseconds and depresses when the order is reversed (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Bi:1998ve"

\end_inset

).
 Spike timing, however is not sufficient to explain how plasticity strengthens
 or weakens synapses.
 Neuromodulators such as dopamine can gate plasticity determining when learning
 can take place (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Pawlak:2010cn"

\end_inset

).
 Indeed, in the locust STDP experiment when octopamine was injected 1 s
 after spike pairing, synapses were only observed to depress their strength
 (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.2.1B$
\end_inset

).
 In flies octopamine is known to act on the mushroom body indirectly, by
 activating PAM dopaminergic neurons (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Waddell:2013fu"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, evidence from studying the locust supports the hypotheses of
 dopamine modulated STDP as the candidate mechanism for learning in the
 fruit fly.

\begin_layout Section
Previous modelling attempts of olfactory learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous modelling efforts of the fruit fly's olfactory circuit have mostly
 focused on the neurons implicated in olfactory processing before olfactory
 information reaches the MBONs.
 This can be explained by the fact that relatively little was known about
 MBONs until three papers dedicated to studying the functional role of mushroom
 body output neuron appeared recently 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hige:2015er,Owald:2015cn"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Aso:2014bh"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there has been one previous modellinhg study that reproduced the
 valence learning capacity of the olfactory circuit (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Wessnitzer:2011dj"

\end_inset

).
 They created a spiking model with dopamine modulated plasticity occurring
 at the synapses between KCs and MBONs and have shown that the MBON can
 learn to distinguish between odours of opposite valences.
 A shortcomming of their model is that in their learning rule the presence
 of dopamine leads to synaptic potentiation which is contrary to current
 evidence.
 In spite of this shortcomming, it is interesting to note that their model
 predicts that the fly can learn an odour mixture discrimination task.
 In the mixture discrimination task one half of the odour is paired with
 a negative reinforcement and another half is neutral.
 This ability has been shown experimentally only in the bee (

Improving previous models of valence learning in the fruit fly
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model that was previously discussed (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Wessnitzer:2011dj"

\end_inset

) provides us with a good starting point, since it implemented a dopamine
 modulated learning rule that allows the model to classify odours of different
 valences with a single MBON.
 We expand on the spiking model proposed in a previous study and we model
 two different types of MBONs, one that represents the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approac
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 biasing MVP2 neuron and another that represents the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

retreat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 biasing 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

 neuron.
 Modelling these two neurons allows us to/visualize the coding space for
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

retreat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 behaviours.
 Furthermore we have also studied competition between MBONs which code for
 opposite valences.
 Finally, we have studied for the first time in the fruit fly the functional
 consequences of bi-directional change of firing rate in MBONs.

Experiments of the 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $MVP2$
\end_inset

 MBONs were performed by David Owald at the CNCB and motivated the simulations
 which were created by the author.
 We describe the first stage of our modelling efforts where we tested a
 plasticity learning rule that depresses the synapse in the presence of
 dopamine.
 The three main neuron types that we modelled here are Kenyon Cells, MBONs
 and DAs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Connectivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used experimental data that traces the connectivity between KCs and output
 neurons (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Aso:2014bh"

\end_inset

).
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

 neuron receives input from 500 KCs from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha'\beta'$
\end_inset

 lobe and 400 KCs from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\beta$
\end_inset

 lobe.
 The MVP2 neuron receives input from 400 KCs from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 lobe and 500 KCs from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha'\beta'$
\end_inset

 lobe.
 We do not know the initial synaptic efficacies (weights) between KCs and
 MBONs, thus we make the assumption that the weights between KCs and MBONs
 have uniform random strengths at start.
 By doing that we found that we needed to tune our synapses with strengths
 between 0 nS and 2 Ns to achieve MBON firing rates of 50 Hz, which is in
 accordance with experimental evidence

\begin_layout Section
MB Kenyon Cells model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the fly is exposed to an odour ~200 KCs activate.
 The two MBONs sample approximately half of the total number of KCs, thus
 only a hundred odour responding KCs send an input MBON.
 We modelled the spike trains for 100 KCs in response to an odour based
 on experimental data (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Turner:2008eo"

\end_inset

).
 In our model an odour is represented as KC spikes.
 In our protocol we first select 100 KCs that will be active to an odour
 and send input to each MBON.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During spontaneous activity each KC fires at approximately ~0.1 Hz.
 Whole cell recording have shown that when an odour is shown KCs fire an
 average of 3 spikes per second.
 In normalized calcium imaging experiments, KCs are found to show a larger
 response in the first 200 ms of the odour exposure (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Turner:2008eo"

\end_inset

).
 We have used this information to generate KC spike trains with an average
 of 3 spikes per second and with a higher probability of a spike to occur
 in the first 200 ms compared to the rest of time.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
MBONs model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a starting point we have modelled two MBONs, one for approach and one
 for retreat (
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

  and 
\begin_inset Formula $MVP2$
\end_inset

).
 As previously discussed, each MBON samples half of the total number of
 KCs.
 The firing rate of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approach
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $MVP2$
\end_inset

 neuron is determined entirely by input KCs.
 For each simulatuion the 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

 neuron receives inhibition from the 
\begin_inset Formula $MVP2$
\end_inset

 MBON, which is accordance with experimental evidence ( David Owald - unpublishe
d work).
 We used a Linear Integrate and Fire (LIF) model with parameters that were
 taken from a recent modelling paper where whole cell recordings of MBONs
 was performed

Odour exposure protocol
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our learning paradigm we require KCs and MBONs to spike, together with
 the presence of dopamine.
 Whole cell recordings have shown how KCs respond when exposed to an odour
 over 1 second, firing at approximately 3 Hz, compared to a spontaneous
 activity of approximately 0.1 Hz (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Turner:2008eo"

\end_inset

).
 We can not know if the KCs fire constantly at 3 Hz for the entire duration
 of appetitive or aversive conditioning or whether they adapt to the odour
 and return to spontaneous activity.
 It is however sufficient to show an odour for 2 seconds coincident with
 reward or punishment for learning to take place (Johannes Freisenbrug -
 personal correspondence).
 For this reason we showed the odour for 2 seconds in our training paradigm.

Our experimental collaborator has shown that when calcium imaging the

 The 
\begin_inset Formula $MVP2$
\end_inset

 MBON is known to change its firing rate only after aversive training.
 We simulated the 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

 and the

\end_inset

 MBONs during these two scenarios to check the prediction 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mbox{Fig\,.\,3.2}$

\begin_layout Standard
In our model the firing rate of the3 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

  neuron determines the retreat drive of an odour, while the firing rate
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $MVP2$
\end_inset

 MBON determines the drive to approach.
 We visualized the valence coding space by plotting their firing rates on
 two different axes (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.\,3.1$
\end_inset

).
 Using our protocol we generated two different odours by creating stereotypical
 KC responses.
 MBONs had a balanced drive of approach and retreat before training, which
 is to say the firing rate of the 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

  and 
\begin_inset Formula $MVP2$
\end_inset

 neurons are approximately equal (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.3.1$
\end_inset

).
 Training an odour with appetitive reinforcement decreased their drive towards
 retreat while, training with aversive reinforcement both decreased their
 drive towards approach and increased their retreat drive.

Bi-directional change in firing rate can occur when dopamine depresses the

\begin_layout Standard
We simulated an appetitive and aversive training protocols by showing odours
 for 2 seconds.
 In the presence of dopamine.
 We monitored the plasticity was active at the KCs-MBONs synapses and how
 this affected odour response before and after learning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observed that during appetitive training KC-
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

  synaptic weights decreased (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.\,3.2\,A,$
\end_inset

 ii).
 After learning, the response from the 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

  neuron shows a decreased firing rate profile compared to the naive state
 (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.\,3.2\,A$
\end_inset

 iii).
 The firing rate decreased by 5 Hz compared to the initial state.
 Conversely, aversive learning increased the response of the 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

  neuron compared to the naive state (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.\,3.2\,B$
\end_inset

 iii).
 This is due to the fact that the firing rate of the MPV2 neuron decreased
 (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.\,3.2\,B\,iv$
\end_inset

), thus increasing the ratio of excitation to inhibition (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig\,.3.3$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To observe a change in the firing rate that qualitatively matched the experiment
al results (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig\,1.2\,B)$
\end_inset

 wee had to choose the strength of the inhibitory MVP2-
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

 synapse that increased the ratio of excitation to inhibition (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig.\,3.4)$
\end_inset

.
 The MBONs we modelled receive input from 100 KCs which fire at a rate of
 3 Hz.
 Every second they receive 300 excitatory spikes with an average weight
 of 1 nS.
 In comparison the 
\begin_inset Formula $M4\beta'$
\end_inset

  inhibiting MVP2 neuron fires at a rate of approximately 50 Hz.
 To obtain the increase in firing rate that qualitatively matches experimental
 results (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig\,1.2\,B)$
\end_inset

 we had to tune the weight of the inhibitory synapse to be twice as strong
 at the excitatory synapse.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The odour representation in valence space moves perpendicularly to the line
 of equal drive and thus has a strong affect, whereas appetitive training
 moves along a single axis.
 This can be explained due to the fact that aversive learning both decreases
 drive to the approach MBON and increase drive to the retreat MBON.

 The M4 MBON increases its firing rate only when there is an inhibitory
 synapse between the MVP2 and M4 Furthermore, if we look at the valence
 coding space (Figure 9 bottom), we observe that the inhibitory synapse
 between the MBON increases discriminability by pushing the representation
 deeper into the retreat area (

Based on evidence that similar odour activates an overlapping subset of

We have selected two odours with 50% overlap in the identity of KCs activated
 two mimic similar odours that appear in nature.
 In the naive state, both of the odours have a neutral valence (

 We subsequently trained, the first odour with both appetitive and aversive
 reinforcement.
 When we tested both of the two odurs for their response in the MBON code

Aversive memories are more stable than appetitive memories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have shown that aversive learning leads to enhanced discriminability
 when compared to appetitive training in our model 
\begin_inset Formula $(Fig\,3.4\,B$
\end_inset

 iii).
 This motivated us to test the following two scenarios.
 We have trained one odour with appetitive reinforcement first and aversive
 training aftewards to observe the change in the position it occupies in
 the odour valence space (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig\,3.5\,A$
\end_inset

).
 Appetitive training for 2 seconds leads to a decrease in the firing rate
 of the M4 neuron (retreat) and converts the neutral odour into an odour
 that signals approach (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig\,3.5\,A)$
\end_inset

.
 When we induce aversive learning immediately afterwards, we observe a decrease
 in the firing rate of the MVP2 neuron (approach) and an increase in the
 firing rate of the M4 neuron.
 The bi-directional change of firing rate converts the odour from signaling
 approach to signaling retreat.
 Conversely in the following simulation we tested what happened when we
 chose to train the odour aversively first.
 The perpendicular movement in the coding space (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig\,3.5\,B$
\end_inset

) due to bi-directional change in the firing rate ensured that the odour
 remained aversive even after we induced appetitive training.
 In our simulation we observed that his result depends on whether appetitive
 and aversive learning decrease the firing rate of the targeted neuron in
 an equal manner.

Discussion and future work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions from preliminary results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have begun to explore how sparse odour information stored in a balanced
 spiking network can be read by the MBONs through a multifactor learning
 rule.
 We have used recent evidence that suggests that approach MBONs inhibit
 retreat MBONs (David Owald - personal communication) and have shown that
 MBON-to-MBON inhibition can lead to enhanced discrimination (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig3.4$
\end_inset

).
 Enhanced discrimination is a property that is useful for a system classifying
 odours, thus it could be possible that there are retreat biasing MBONs
 that inhibit approach biasing MBONs.
 If this is true than both aversive and appetitive learning would induce
 bi-directional changes of firing rate into subsets of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approach
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 MBONs and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

retreat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 MBONs.
 In our model we tested bi-directional change that occurrs only during aversive
 learning.
 In such a scenario, we predict that training the same odour successively
 with both aversive and appetitive reinforcement would change the valence
 from appetitive to aversive if the odour was trained appetitive first and
 keep the valence aversive if aversive training occurred first.
 Our results suggest that in the fruit fly good odour memories with are
 easier to convert into bad memories and bad memories are more resilient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have visualized the coding space created by the firing rates of the MBONs
 create in response to an odour.
 The valence space was inspired by experimental evidence that shows the
 highest degree of separation in terms of MBON firing rates is when odours
 have different valances rather than different identities (

).
 While MBONs may be very good at separating odours based on their valences
 it could be possible that other information could be stored in the spike
 times of the MBONs, such as information about odour identity or qualitative
 factors such as what kind of reward the odour predicts: water, food, mating.
 It is also worth noting that the experimental paradigm uses simple stimuli
 to train the fly which might restrict the ability of the neuron to learn
 complex interactions.
 For example we know that the flies are capable to associate an odour that
 predicts another odour that predicts reward which is called second ordour
 conditioning (

Learning over larger periods of time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have modelled two dopaminergic neurons in our model one for each learning
 scenario: appetitive and aversive.
 The dopaminergic neurons create a temporal window in which plasticity can
 depress a synapse.
 The time window during which coincidence spikes and dopamine presence can
 depress a synapse is 20 ms in our model.
 However, there is evidence that the outcome of learning depends on the
 timing of the odour and the punishment over larger intervals of time (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Yarali:2008dt"

\end_inset

) A fly that is shown an odour first and shocked 15 s later will learn to
 avoid the odour (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Yarali:2008dt"

\end_inset

).
 If the sequence is reversed and a fly is shocked first the odour will become
 appetitive (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Yarali:2008dt"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore if a fly is shocked with a strong shock first paired with an
 odour and a milder shock later paired with a different odour the fly will
 learn to approach the second odour (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Perisse:2013fp"

\end_inset

).
 Our model fails to replicate these results that belongs to the paradigm
 of relief learning because the shock signal always leads to depression
 of the approach pathway in our model.
 One possible solution to this problem could be that the activity of appetitive
 and aversive dopaminergic neurons is relative to past experiences.
 In our model we can test a paradigm, where when we would stop a shock signal
 after a period of time, the aversive dopaminergic neurons will decrease
 their activity and the appetitive dopaminergic neurons will show an increase
 in their activity.

\begin_layout Subsection
Second order conditioning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our first model investigating plasticity in the MB we have used a learning
 rule that leads to synaptic depression when dopamine in present (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Greenspan:2004iu"

\end_inset

).
 However, the fly is able to learn to approach an odour that predicts another
 appetitive trained odour.
 This could be because during second order conditioning when the fly is
 exposed to the appetitive odour, appetitive dopaminergic neurons increase
 their activity which makes the fly susceptible to learn to consider the
 second odour as being appetitive.
 We would like to explore how we can tune the activity of dopaminergic neurons
 in response to not only reward and punishment but also odour stimuli such
 as odours.
 A candidate mechanism that could explain this might be the feedback loop
 from MBONs to DAs.

 We would like to examine the functional consequences that such a feedback
 loop has to learning and test different scenarios - what happens when the
 feedback loop is excitatory or inhibitory.

State dependent memory retrieval 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experimental collaborator has recently shown that the approach MVP2
 output neuron increases its response to an odour when the fruit fly is
 hungry (
\begin_inset Formula $Fig\,1.3$
\end_inset

).
 This implies that the olfactory circuit is modulated by the behavioural
 state of the organism.
 A plausible mechanism which has been explored in cortex is inhibition,
 which has been linked to brain states such as attention (Harris and Thiele
 2011, Stringer et al., 2015 ).
 We would like to explore how inhibition in the MB changes in response to
 motivational state.
 A candidate neuron mechanism might be APL state dependent inhibition, which
 is a neuron that inhibits the entire population of KCs (
