OCIAM Thesis for LyX - files to copy - readme
---------------------------------------------

You need to copy 'ociamthesis-lyx' to your latex install.

On Mac using MacTex, this goes into:
Users/[username]/Library/texmf/tex/latex/ociamthesis-lyx.cls

You'll have to figure out where this goes yourself if you're on Windows or Linux.

Next, you need to copy 'ociamthesis-lyx.layout' to your lyx install.

On a Mac, this goes in:
/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/LyX-1.6/layouts

Again, you'll have to figure out where this goes yourself on other OSes (windows probably puts it in c:/program files/lyx-1.6/layouts or something like that).

Once you've done this, run 'reconfigure' from LyX, restart LyX, and it should then be good to go.
