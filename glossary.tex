\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
$\mathbf{KC}$ - Kenyon Cells, a group of neurons which reside in
the Mushroom Body

$\mathbf{MBONs}$ - A group of 32 mushroom body output neuronsc that
receive input from KCs

$\mathbf{APL}$ - Anterior Paired Lateral neuron, a global inhibitory
neuron that inhibits all KCs

$\mathbf{MVP2}$ - an MBON which biases for approach behaviour

$\mathbf{M4\beta'}$ - an MBON which biases for retreat behaviour

$\mathbf{DAs}$- Dopaminergic Neurons, a group of neurons that become
activate either to an appetitive or an aversive stimulus 

$\mathbf{PAM}$- a cluster of dopaminergic neurons (DAs) that provide
positive reinforcement to MBONs

$\mathbf{PPL}$ - a cluster of dopaminergic neurons thast receive 

$\mathbf{CS+}$- $conditional$ $stimulus$, an odour which is paired
with reinforcement, the term CS+ is used both in the case of aversive
and appetitive reinforcement

$\mathbf{CS-}$ an odour which is presented without reinforcement

$\mathbf{\alpha\beta,\alpha'\beta','\gamma}$ lobes- the three main
anatomical subdivisions of the MB. $\alpha,\alpha'$ are vertical
lobes and $\beta,\beta',\gamma$ are horizontal. %
